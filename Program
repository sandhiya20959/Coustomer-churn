Sample dataset (small and simple)
data = {
    'MonthlyCharges': [20, 70, 60, 90, 30, 100, 25, 80],
    'Tenure': [1, 24, 12, 36, 2, 40, 3, 30],
    'Churn': [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1 = Churned, 0 = Stayed
}

Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

Features and target
X = df[['MonthlyCharges', 'Tenure']]
y = df['Churn']

Split into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=0)

Train the model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

Accuracy
print("Predicted:", y_pred)
print("Actual:   ", y_test.values)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
